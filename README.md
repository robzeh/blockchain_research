**The Impact of Blockchain in FinTech**

_Since the 1990s, mathematicians have long researched the underlying foundations
of blockchain technology. It was only in 2008 with the revolutionary proposal of Bitcoin where
the protocol was finally put to the test. Since then, it has been hailed as a radical, disruptive
development in money and currency being the first example of a digital asset which has no
central controller. However, an arguably more important aspect of the Bitcoin experiment is the
underlying blockchain technology as a tool for distributed consensus, tamper-proof construction
and information transparency. This paper will explore the evolution of blockchain, the recent
major developments in the ecosystem and the innovative, socioeconomic impacts in the financial
services industry._

**Scaling Decentralized Finance**

_Decentralized finance has emerged as the most popular use case for
blockchain technology. Smart contract compatible blockchains such as Ethereum
have enabled the offering of complex financial services in decentralized form. As
a result, there has been an increasing number of users driving up the cost of using
the network. For blockchain ecosystems to scale with this growth of activity, there
needs to be changes in the underlying architecture. This paper will explore the
scaling solutions being researched, which can be classified as Layer 1 and Layer
2 solutions._
